<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
I am broadly interested in (so far, mostly hyperbolic) geometry and its interactions with
  dynamics. Specifically, I have studied dynamical
  properties of <b>asymptotically geodesic surfaces</b> in hyperbolic 3-manifolds 
  and how these surfaces reveal properties of their ambient manifold in (1) and (2) below.
I have also studied slope gap distributions of saddle connections of flat surfaces in (3).

  Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of renormalized gaps between slopes of saddle connections on translation surfaces. 
  Specifically, we describe a procedure for finding the winning holonomy vectors as defined by Kumanduri-Sanchez-Wang,
  which constitutes a key step in calculating the slope gap distribution for an arbitrary Veech surface. 
  We then apply this method to explicitly compute the gap distribution for the regular double heptagon translation surface.
   This extends work of Athreya-Chaika-Lelievre on the gap distribution for the golden L translation surface, which is equivalent 
  to the regular double pentagon surface.

  Abstract: A sequence of distinct closed surfaces in a hyperbolic 3-manifold M is
  <i>asymptotically geodesic</i> 
  if their principal curvatures tend
  uniformly to zero. When M has finite volume, we show such sequences are always asymptotically dense in the 2-plane Grassmann bundle of M.
  When M has infinite volume and is geometrically finite, we show such sequences do not exist. 
  As an application of the former, we obtain partial answers to the question of whether a negatively curved 
  Riemannian 3-manifold that contains a sequence of asymptotically totally geodesic or totally 
  umbilic surfaces must be hyperbolic. Finally, we give examples to show that if the dimension of M is 
  greater than 3, the possible limiting behavior of asymptotically geodesic surfaces is less constrained 
  than for totally geodesic surfaces.

  Abstract: Let \(M\) be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. 
  Let \(\nu_{Gr(M)}\) denote the probability volume (Haar) measure of the 
  2-plane Grassmannian \(Gr(M)\) of \(M\) and let \(\nu_T\) denote the area measure on 
  \(Gr(M)\) of an immersed closed totally geodesic surface \(T\) in \(M\). We say a 
  sequence of \(\pi_1\)-injective maps \(f_i:S_i\to M\) of surfaces \(S_i\) is 
  <i>asymptotically Fuchsian</i> if \(f_i\) is \(K_i\)-quasifuchsian with \(K_i\to 1\) 
  as \(i\to \infty\). We show that the set of weak-* limits of the probability area 
  measures induced by \(f_i\) on \(Gr(M)\), where \(f_i:S_i\to M\) are asymptotically
 Fuchsian minimal or pleated maps of closed connected surfaces \(S_i\), consists of all 
  convex combinations of \(\nu_{Gr(M)}\) and the \(\nu_T\).
