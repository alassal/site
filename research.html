I study surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Specifically, I have been working on the following:
</p>

<p>
<big>Limits of increasingly geodesic quasifuchsian surfaces in a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold</big> (In preparation)
</p>

  Abstract: Let \(M\) be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. 
	Let \(\nu_{\Gr M}\) denote the probability volume (Haar) measure of the 
	2-plane Grassmannian \(\Gr M\) of \(M\) and let \(\nu_T\) denote the area measure on 
	\(\Gr M\) of an immersed closed totally geodesic surface \(T\se M\) We say a 
	sequence of \(\pi_1\)-injective maps \(f_i:S_i\to M\) of surfaces \(S_i\) is 
	<i>asymptotically Fuchsian</i> if \(f_i\) is \(K_i\)-quasifuchsian with \(K_i\to 1\) 
	as \(i\to \infty\). We show that the set of weak-* limits of the probability area 
	measures of \(f_i(S_i)\), where \(f_i:S_i\to M\) are increasingly Fuchsian minimal 
	or pleated maps of closed connected surfaces \(S_i\), consists of all 
	convex combinations of \(\nu_{\Gr M}\) and the \(\nu_T\).
