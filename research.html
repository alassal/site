<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
I study surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Specifically, I have been working on the following:

<big>Limits of increasingly geodesic quasifuchsian surfaces in a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold</big> (In preparation)
</p>

<p>
  Abstract: Suppose \(S_i \) is a sequence of immersed \(K_i \)-quasifuchsian closed connected oriented essential surfaces in a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold \(M \). Denote by \(\nu_i \) the unit area measures of the \(S_i \) in the 2-plane Grassmanian \(Gr(M) \) of \(M \). Then, the weak-* limits of the \(\nu_i \) are always finite convex combinations of the unit volume measure of \(Gr(M)\) and the unit area measures of the totally geodesic surfaces of \(M \). Moreover, any such convex combination may arise as a limit.
