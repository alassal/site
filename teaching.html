<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>
I like teaching math in different contexts and trying to help students to flourish and enjoy it. I have taught calculus classes at Yale, namely Single Variable Calculus I (Math 112), as well as Multivariable Calculus (Math 120) two times. In addition, I have also taught Introduction to College Mathematics (a University of New Haven class coded Math 1107) at the MacDougal-Walker CI via the <a href="https://www.yaleprisoneducationinitiative.org">Yale Prison Education Initiative</a>. Finally, I have taught a summer class introducing high school students to hyperbolic geometry in an elementary fashion, via <a href="https://www.eduexplora.com">EduExplora</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the Fall 2025 semester I am teaching two sections of Precalculus (Math 114) at UW-Madison, which I also have taught 
 in the 2024-2025 academic year.

<h3>Research mentoring</h3>

<p>
In the 2023 Summer Mathematics Research at Yale program, I have co-mentored 
 with Taylor McAdam five undergraduate students on a project to compute
 saddle connections of the double heptagon flat surface. Two years later 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19252">posted</a>
 our article on the Arxiv.

<h3>Directed reading program</h3>

<p>
For several years I organized the Yale mathematics <a href="https://sites.google.com/yale.edu/yaledrp/home">directed reading program</a> (DRP), which pairs undergraduate students with a graduate mentor to do a reading of a certain math topic, not for credit. Usually, slightly non-standard topics are chosen and the undergraduate participants enjoy learning and meeting with their mentors. I have mentored seven students via the DRP, mostly reading <em>Introduction to Stochastic Processes</em> by Greg Lawler as well as adjacent topics depending on the interests of the students.
